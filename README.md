# EEG-Signal-Analysis-for-P300-Extraction
Welcome to the EEG Signal Analysis repository, focusing on the extraction of P300 signals using synchronous averaging techniques. This project aims to provide insights into the optimal number of repetitions required to reliably capture the P300 response, a crucial component in various applications such as BCIs and cognitive neuroscience research.
